# Secure Landing Zone (Azure)

## Overview

This project will implement a **Secure Landing Zone (SLZ)** in Microsoft Azure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The purpose of this SLZ is to establish a secure, scalable, and policy-compliant foundation for future cloud workloads, following Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) principles.

> **Note:** This project is currently in the **planning phase**. Development has not started yet.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

As part of this project, I aim to:

- Build an enterprise-grade Azure environment using Terraform
- Learn and apply governance tools like Management Groups, Azure Policy, and RBAC
- Set up core infrastructure services: networking, identity, logging, monitoring, and security
- Practice automating secure cloud deployments for long-term scalability

---

## How This Connects to the Cloud Resume Challenge

This SLZ will act as the **foundation layer** for my [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://github.com/KhamkeoQuest/cloud-resume-challenge) project.

Once complete, the resume site and backend API will be deployed into this environment, benefiting from:
- Enforced security and tagging policies
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Isolated dev/stage/prod environments
- Scalable and cost-managed infrastructure

This integration will demonstrate how cloud applications can be securely deployed and managed in real-world enterprise-style environments.
